# Knockel's Floor Covering — new website (draft)

A preview, living for now inside the Valve-Finder repository. It will move to its own repository
(and later to knockelsfloorcovering.com) once the store is happy with it.

- `index.html` — the home page. The opening floor lays itself as you scroll (`assets/home.js`).
- `room.html` — "Try a floor in your room": a visitor's photo, four corners, and a sample laid in
  perspective with the room's own light (`assets/room.js`). Everything runs on the visitor's device.
- `catalog.json` — the samples in the room tool and on the home page. To add a real product, put a
  straight-on photo in `assets/floors/` and a 560 px copy in `assets/floors/thumbs/`, then add an entry.
  `size` is how many metres wide the photo is in real life; `across: true` if its boards run left to right.

## Still needed from the store
- Store hours (the page says "Call ahead for store hours" until then).
- What "Pick-Up Services" means, in one sentence.
- Real photos: the storefront, the showroom, finished jobs, the people.
- Product photos for the catalog.
